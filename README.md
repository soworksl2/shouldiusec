This is a web calculator to indicate if it is worth to use C for a project. this project is intended for educational purposes only, and to be honest for my need to learn web development.

Also, this page is an extra for my complete article [Ya C esta muerto? Origen, evolucion y actualidad](https://medium.com/@jimy.waner11/ya-c-esta-muerto-origen-evoluci%C3%B3n-y-actualidad-c5314325b3f2).

The English Version will coming soon...

# How to Build

This project is vanilla JS, HTML, and Css. so you only need to download this repo and open the index.html in a browser. if you want to be sure that it works fine. you can serve this files with an http server like `python -m http.server`. it's up to you.
